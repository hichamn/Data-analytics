# Data-analytics
This code imports the statistics library and uses it to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a list of numbers. You can create a new file in your repository and add this code to it. Remember to give the file a descriptive name, such as mean_and_stdev.py, and to include a brief comment at the top of the file to explain what the code does.

You can also modify this code to work with your own data by replacing the list data with your own list of numbers.
